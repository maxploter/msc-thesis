Tamara Munzner (www.bit.ly/tmunzner) presents very lucid and useful guidelines for creating effective visualizations, including how to correctly rank visual channel types and how to use categorical color constraints. She explains advantages of 2D representation and drawbacks of 3D, immersive, or animated visualizations. She also describes how to create visualizations that reduce the viewer's cognitive load, and how to validate visualizations. This talk was presented at {VIZBI} 2011, an international conference series on visualizing biological data (vizbi.org) funded by {NIH} \& {EMBO}. Slides from the talk are at bit.ly/{nCJM}5U.

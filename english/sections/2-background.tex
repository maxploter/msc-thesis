\subsection{Video Object Detection} \label{Background:VideoObjectDetection}

% Object detection definition. Deep learning pushed performance of single image object detection.

Object detection is a foundational challenge in computer vision and has been a subject of research for several decades \cite{fischlerRepresentationMatchingPictorial1973}. The goal of the object detection task is to find object(s) of given description in images and videos. Advancements in deep learning techniques to learn feature representations  \cite{hintonReducingDimensionalityData2006, lecunDeepLearning2015} have pushed the performance of single-image object detection \cite{girshickRichFeatureHierarchies2014a}.

% Present challenges with video object detection.

Video object detection presents unique challenges compared to single image detection due to the inherent temporal and spatial information within video sequences. Specifically, motion blur, occlusion, and object overlap can hinder accurate detection. Leveraging temporal information is crucial for disambiguating similar objects, tracking objects across frames, and enhancing detection accuracy by providing contextual understanding.

% State-of-the-Art

In order to utilise temporal information researchers proposed an idea to use prostprocessing to improve detection results \cite{TODO}. The approach is quite simple they take high confidence detections in adjecent frames and use them to improve results. The main difference between those methods are the mapping strategy. Howerver, postprocessing apraoch for videso detection has a few limitations like error from detection model is propogated to the postprocessing which has no way to recover the error \cite{}, not temporal consistency \cite{} and finally temporal information was not fully utilised.

% not clear what does it mean motion information?
Next researches suggested to introduce motion and time information during training to form an end-to-end solution. Additional models can be divided by methods they use sucha as optical flow, context, or trajectory.a
Optical flow rely on key frames which supplement the current frame. Optical flow is an old task proposed in 1981 \cite{TODO}. However, optical flow has dow.

Context method rely on recurrent models to capture object associations for a longer timeframe than optical flow.


Video object detection algorithms can be classified into four categories \ref{FIGURE} \cite{TODO}.

First, the easiers approach is to postporcess image object detection results.

Second, use axilary network to extract motion information.a
